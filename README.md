# Quiz App Project

Fourth Project for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree by Google.

The goal was to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of my choice.
Within the quiz I had to include at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.
App also includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.
